## 🤝 Open Source Contributions

### 🎹 KeyboardScanner (Arduino MIDI Controller)

I contributed to the **KeyboardScanner** project, an open source Arduino-based MIDI controller firmware, for to reuse keyboard keys, alongside **Daniel Moura**, the original author of the repository.

My contributions included:

- ✅ Added support for **FATAR TP40, Kurzweil SP76II, MAudio Axiom Pro configuration and schematics**
- 🔧 Implemented **velocity sensitivity curves** for more expressive key response
- 🎛 Start of added support for **potentiometers** to extend control capabilities
- 🧩 Suggested restructuring the codebase into reusable modules

This collaboration improved support for additional hardware and enhanced the usability of the project for diverse keyboard matrix configurations, helping to make it more modular and easier to maintain.
