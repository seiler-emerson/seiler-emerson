### Good to see you here! &nbsp;![](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=seiler-emerson)

    Mechanical Engineer with specialization in Biomedical Engineering, currently studying in the Postgraduate program - MBA Data Science and Analytics at USP/Esalq.
    With experience in full stack development, we contribute significantly to two distinct software segments.
    The first is the creation of indicator analysis systems aimed at public health. These systems play a critical role in improving decision-making and promoting more effective public health.
    Additionally, I work on developing systems for managing care in medical clinics.
    My role allows me to be in contact with practically many of the project phases:
    - Management of the development team.
    - Planning the data structure, logic and system design.
    - Front-end and back-end development.
    - Implement systems.
    - Server management.
